The Object Detection and Navigation Assistant is an Android mobile application designed to assist blind users in navigating and interacting with their environment. It utilizes advanced computer vision and spatial mapping techniques to provide real-time object detection, localization, and navigation guidance.

## Features
- Real-time object detection and recognition
- Spatial mapping and localization
- Step-by-step navigation assistance
- Natural language voice interaction
- Haptic feedback for non-visual cues
- User customization and personalization
- Collaborative mapping and crowdsourcing
- Accessibility features for blind users
